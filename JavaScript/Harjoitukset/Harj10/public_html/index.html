    <h2>Dodo</h2>
    <div id="teksti">The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.
        Its closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves.
        The closest extant relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon.
        A white dodo was once incorrectly thought to have existed on the nearby island of RÃ©union.

    <h2>Scrooge</h2>
    <div id ="teksti">Scrooge McDuck is a cartoon character created in 1947 by Carl Barks and licensed by The Walt Disney Company. 
        Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic Pekin Duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. 
        He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats and is portrayed in animations as speaking with a slight Scottish accent, 
        also sometimes known as a Scottish burr. 
        His dominant character trait is his thrift, and within the context of the fictional Disney universe, he is the world's richest person.
